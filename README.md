# Data Science Portfolio

This is a repository of the projects that I have worked on or are in progress. The projects are written in Python (Jupyter Notebook). The goal of the projects is to to use Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and/or statistical modelling techniques to answer a specific question or find something interesting. A typical project consist of finding and cleaning data, visualization, statistical analysis and conclusion. Click on the projects to see full analysis and code.

# Projects

## Machine Learning Algorithms
[Linear Regression](https://github.com/shaifali20/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
- A linear regression model is applied to an e-commerce dataset to decide whether to focus the efforts of the company on its mobile app or website development based on customer behavior.

[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/shaifali20/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
- A logistic regression model is applied to an advertising dataset to predict whether or not the user will click on an advertisement based off of the features of that user.

[K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/shaifali20/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb)
- A KNN classification model is applied to a classified data set to directly predict a class for a new data point based off of the features. The dataset has hidden feature column names but the target class and data are provided.

[Decision Tree and Random Forest](https://github.com/shaifali20/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Decision%20Tree%20and%20Random%20Forest/Decision%20Tree%20and%20Random%20Forest.ipynb)
- Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this. Lending Club had a [very interesting year in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club#2016), so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind.
- A publicly available dataset from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com) has been used to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.

[Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/shaifali20/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Support%20Vector%20Machines/Support%20Vector%20Machines%20-%20Breast%20Cancer.ipynb)
- The Support Vector Machines algorithm is applied to a scikit-learn's built-in data set of breast cancer to design a classification model that predicts whether a cancer is Malignant or Benign.

[K Means Clustering](https://github.com/shaifali20/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/K%20Means%20Clustering/K%20Means%20Clustering.ipynb)
- The K Means Clustering algorithm is applied to a university data set to design a classifier that predicts whether a university is a Private Univesrsity or a Public University. 

[Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/shaifali20/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20-PCA/Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20(PCA).ipynb)
- The Principal Componenet Analysis (PCA) algorithm is applied to a scikit-learn's built-in data set of breast cancer to identify the first 2 principal components and visualize the data in 2-dimensions.

[Recommender Systems](https://github.com/PKandarp/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Recommender%20Systems/Recommender%20Systems.ipynb)
- Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems are implemented that suggests the movies based on a famous MovieLens data set.
- Implemented a Model-based CF recommender system by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and a Memory-based CF by computing cosine similarity.

[Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/PKandarp/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Natural%20Language%20Processing.ipynb)
- The Natural Language Processing has been used to design a classifier that classifies Yelp Reviews into 1 star of 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.

[Deep Learning and Neural Networks](https://github.com/PKandarp/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20and%20Neural%20Networks/Deep%20Learning.ipynb)
- The Neural Networks/Deep Learning algorithm is applied on the Bank Authentication Data Set from UCI repository to classify whether or not a Bank Note is authentic.
- The result of classifier is also compared with the result of a Random Forest classifer.
